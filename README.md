# Pattern-2D-Shape-Searching-and-Visualization
In this project, we have a huge file which contains the co-ordinates of components which are fabricated onto a multilayered hardware chip. Somehow some of the components became defective so I have to find the co-ordinates of all defective components. They could be exact match of given sample patterns or will look similar to sample patterns.

#Input : 1. Data file which contains the information of Hardware chip(all the co-ordinates of all the components).
        2. Sample file which co-ordinates of single or multiple components.
#Output : return a file which will contains all the co-ordinates of defective components.

#Note: in the data file all the components which are defective could be in other form also like, rotated by some angle or sharing               the edge with other components.
